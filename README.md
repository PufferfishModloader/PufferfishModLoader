## A fast, light-weight and powerful mod loader for Minecraft
PufferfishModLoader is the next-level of Minecraft Modding. PML is designed to be light-weight, fast and powerful. (and of course, developer-friendly)

### I want to use PML, but I'm not sure about it... Why should I use it?
Our goal is to provide users with a stable and light-weight mod loader which is also capable of handling tons of mods, without the performance impact. 

One mod jar can support all Minecraft versions that you wish to support (and that PML supports) without you having to make a single change. You can read more about how this works [here](https://github.com/PufferfishModLoader/PufferfishModLoader). If you want somewhere to start off, check out our [Mod Workspace](https://github.com/PufferfishModLoader/PufferfishModWorkspace).

### I'm a developer, why should I use this for my mods?
As developers, we understand the struggle of updating your codebase for newer versions. With PML, we try our best to make our modding system adapt to newer versions of Minecraft, while also keeping support for older versions.

### Features
- Easy dependency management
- Lightweight
- Multi-version support with no code changes (one jar supports all)
- Easy to use [UI Framework](https://github.com/PufferfishModLoader/PufferfishUI)
- Flexible configuration system
- User-friendly update system
- and more...
